My elderly sister decided for the first time to stay up until midnight on New Year's Eve in New York City to watch the ball drop. The next morning, she reported that she was disappointed. When I asked her why, she said that on the news the day before, the reporters had talked about the crystals inside the ball and what a piece would be worth if someone got ahold of one. But then the ball descended very slowly. She'd expected it to crash and that people would scramble for the pieces. She'd wanted to see that!
