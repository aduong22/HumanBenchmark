I started quilting so I could spend time with my aunt. I didn't accomplish much until my little sister was put into the hospital. She lived 13 hours away, which meant I couldn't be at her side, but I could pray, and I could make her a blanket. Every stitch was sewn with prayer and tears, memories woven in between layers of cotton and polyester. Doctors said she was going to die at least three times. I sewed faster. By God's good grace, I delivered that blanket two years ago, and my sister still sleeps under it today.
